# Landing Page Project

Actually, the landing page project is considered a landing page that contains nav bars and multiple sections, the main function of that page is how to create a navigation list of items dynamically means that if you add more sections to it this will result in an equivalent number of the list item also when scrolling we can distinguish the active section that appears in the viewport.

## ðŸ›  Skills

Javascript, HTML, CSS...

## Features

- Dynamic navigation list items build by js
- Has some beautiful animation
- Smooth Scroll behavior
- There are at least 5 sections that have been added to the page.

## Lessons Learned

during working on this project I have learned a lot and implemented a lot of things learned in this course

- working with document object and how to create an element and how to lay it in the DOM tree.
- using appendChild(), textContent, and innerHTML.
- listen for events like click event and scrolling event and how to replay to that event listeners
- dealing with code performance and how to write code with a low number of reflow and repainting processes
- some challenges I have faced like how to use getBoundingClientRect() to check the current position for the section and I have searched in developer.mozilla and found help there, link down in the links section.
- (update) after the project review with bug or error as all sections show active class. I update the code to depend on Intersection Observer API. learning it was so much fun and I love it. it is more accurate and easy to use plus it will not act depending on scrolling event which will give us a very performance advantage over getBoundingCLientRect() the old one.
- (update) after I finished implementing the observer I test it and can see that element in the developer tool can change its active class in the right way test screen shot also in the last link.
- (additional implementation) I also do additional implementation so that now the nav list is also highlighted with the proper section.
